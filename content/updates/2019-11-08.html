    Whoa! It's been a long time since I posted an update. Well, that's because I got a new job last month, and my head is scrambled. I'm now at Buoyant building tools for platform owners so they can get live insights into their Kubernetes clusters. It's a pretty big switch from building a wedding website service, but I'm loving the change. So many new things to learn!
