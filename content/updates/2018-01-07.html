            Recently, I ran across "Loney, Noir" by Loney Dear on an old hard drive, it was one of my favorite albums ten years ago. I went to listen to it on Spotify, and what do you know, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/1FNA7rx5To03Xpv2wb8zoj">he has a new album</a>. It's going to be another favorite.
