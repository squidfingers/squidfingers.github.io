            I've been on the lookout for a used 38mm Hamilton Khaki Field Auto for a bit, but now Hamilton has released the <a href="https://shop.hodinkee.com/blogs/journal/hamilton-khaki-field-mechanical">Hamilton Khaki Field Mechanical</a>, which may end my search for an Auto. I love that there's no date, the bold design, brushed case, and the hand-wound movement. While the price is good for a watch of this quality, it's still a bit steep for me. Hmm, maybe I could justify it if I sold all my other watches ...
