{{< article "the-pragmatic-programmer.jpg" >}}

I'm excited to see an update to [The Pragmatic Programmer](https://pragprog.com/book/tpp20/the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition) has been released for its 20th anniversary. This book has had a big impact on my thought processes throughout my career. The principals I learned from it, such as DRY, abstraction, reuse, and organization, are still ingrained in the methods I use to design Minted's component library.
