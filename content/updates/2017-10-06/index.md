I'm in love with the [Oris ChronOris Date](https://www.hodinkee.com/articles/oris-chronoris-date-hands-on). It's strikes the perfect balance between subtlety and uniqueness. I also find it refreshing that it has a 39mm case, and is 43mm lug to lug. Here's a [video overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOVrbPHWbLY) from Worn and Wound.

I'll probably never own an Oris due to the price, so I was excited to see Seiko release the [SRPB13](http://www.creationwatches.com/products/seiko-automatic-watches-69/seiko-5-sports-automatic-japan-made-srpb13-srpb13j1-srpb13j-mens-watch-11607.html), which has a similar aesthetic. Unfortunately, Seiko made it 44mm wide, which is too big for my taste.
