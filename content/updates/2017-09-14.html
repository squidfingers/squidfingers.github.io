            Zenith has introduced the new <a href="http://www.ablogtowatch.com/zenith-defy-lab-watch-15-hz/">Defy Lab watch</a>, which they say is the most accurate mechanical watch ever made. It runs at a frequency five-times greater than a standard mechanical watch and has a 60-hour power reserve. I'm also loving the material it's made from, which is called aeronith. It's an ultra-light aluminum composite that looks a bit like concrete. The price? Just $31,000 if you want one of the first 10. See a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSMjUsHwDRA">video overview</a> from aBlogtoWatch.
