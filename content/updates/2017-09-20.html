            I love <a href="https://engine.xyz">The Engine</a>, a site recently launched by MIT. The attention to detail is perfect; it's easy to explore, yet not boring. It also looks fantastic on all devices. Illustration and animation by <a href="https://instagram.com/baugasm/">Vasjen Katro</a>.
