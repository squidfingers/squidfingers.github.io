If you're just learning Hugo like me, you may want to start with [Go's template documentation](https://tip.golang.org/pkg/text/template/). The conditional sytax tripped me up for a minute. If you're accustomed to writing conditionals like this:

```javascript
if ($x == $y)
if ($x && $y)
if ($x == $y || $x == $z)
```

This is how it would look in a Go template:

```go-template
{{ if eq $x $y }}
{{ if and $x $y }}
{{ if or (eq $x $y) (eq $x $z) }}
```

In a Go template, `eq` is a function that you pass arguments to, not a comparison operator like you would use in JavaScript.
