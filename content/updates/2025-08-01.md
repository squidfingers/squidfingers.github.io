I finally rebuilt this site from the ground up using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). With this version, I wanted to take advantage of the template improvements introduced in v0.147.0. I also didn't want to use any CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap or Tailwind, or use any JavaScript. Just Scss, HTML, and Markdown. There's nothing super crazy going on here, but if you're interested, you can checkout the [source code on GitHub](https://github.com/squidfingers/squidfingers.github.io).
