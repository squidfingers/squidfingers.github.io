I finally rebuilt this site from the ground up using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). With this version, I wanted to take advantage of the template improvements introduced in [v0.146.0](https://gohugo.io/templates/new-templatesystem-overview/). I also didn't want to use any CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap or Tailwind, and only use minimal JavaScript for enhancements. Just Scss, HTML, and Markdown. There's nothing super crazy going on here, but if you're interested, you can checkout the [source code on GitHub](https://github.com/squidfingers/squidfingers.github.io).
