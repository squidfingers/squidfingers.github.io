Over the past year, I've been designing a [new UI system](/projects/minted-component-library/) and workflow for the entire online experience at Minted. It powers everything from the e-commerce flow, contact management, and SAAS products. Such a complex and rewarding problem to solve. We are slowly rolling it out to the site, but I'm very happy that [Minted Wedding Websites](/projects/minted-wedding-websites/) is one of the first products to be rebuilt. This gave us the opportunity to clean up the experience a bit, and build in some big features our customers have always wanted. As the system matures, I have also been pleased to see the speed and efficiency it has brought to the design workflow. I'm excited to hear what our customers think about the changes, and look forward to continually improving their experience at Minted using this new system.
