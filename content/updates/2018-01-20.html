            While Netflix spends their time trying to figure out what I would like to watch (or what they want me to watch), all I really want is just a <a href="http://flixable.co">simple list ordered by date and IMDb rating</a>. I would be surprised if Flixable can keep up with the bandwidth costs, but I sure hope it sticks around.
