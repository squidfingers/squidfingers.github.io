<p>
  Awhile back I created a prototype of a blog for a project I was working on.
</p>
<p>
  It's built in Hugo, and is integrated with Tailwind 4 and Lunr search. It has features such as related posts, author profiles, tags, and implements Hugo's resource processing on all user uploaded images. This makes it ready for image uploads using a static site CMS such as <a href="https://pagescms.org/">Pages CMS</a> (my favorite at the moment).
