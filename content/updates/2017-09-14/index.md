Zenith has introduced the new [Defy Lab watch](http://www.ablogtowatch.com/zenith-defy-lab-watch-15-hz/), which they say is the most accurate mechanical watch ever made. It runs at a frequency five-times greater than a standard mechanical watch and has a 60-hour power reserve. I'm also loving the material it's made from, which is called aeronith. It's an ultra-light aluminum composite that looks a bit like concrete. The price? Just $31,000 if you want one of the first 10.
