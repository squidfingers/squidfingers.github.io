<p>
    Back when I had a little more time, I liked to create multi-colored linocuts. I really loved carving for days, not being able to see the results until the first print. Some day I'd like to get back into that, but in the meantime I've tried to recreate the same technique digitally. It's not quite as therapeutic, but it is fun drawing in reverse. I've been experimenting with how to achieve the look using Lars' favorite cartoons as the subject matter. This one is Wanda and the Alien.
