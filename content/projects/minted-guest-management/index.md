Guest List management, guest communication, & guest details

{{< blurb >}}
Through user research, it became clear that Minted could engage the wedding customer earlier in their wedding journey if Guest List Management was separated from [Minted Wedding Websites](./minted-wedding-websites/). It would allow the customer to begin their wedding planning without the requirement of photos and content. It would also enable Minted to deliver on the promise of fully-integrated products: build the guest list once, and access it in any wedding product or service.
