In 2013, I co-founded Hitched Up, a service aiming to be the easiest, fastest way to build your wedding RSVP site. Hitched Up was acquired by Minted in 2015.

Minted Wedding Websites is a web-based product that has evolved to provide event management, guest list management, guest communication, and RSVP tracking. It also includes tools to create a customizable website for the wedding guests to manage content for gift registries, accommodations, directions, photos, wedding party, and information about the couple.
