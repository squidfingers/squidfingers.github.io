summary: "I excel as an early-stage UX/UI designer in a Lean UX environment. I prefer working within a cross-functional team to get feedback as early as possible so it can be used to make fast decisions. I'm passionate about creating enjoyable experiences that are not cumbersome or distracting, and try to design interfaces that are intuitive to use.\n\nThings I like to do: user interface guidelines and component libraries; wireframes, prototypes, and user interface mockups; I like to collaborate on: user interviews, usability testing, and surveys; I prefer using: Figma, Sketch, and Principal, ~~but I'll use the Adobe Creative Suite if I have to~~; I also love to play around with HTML5, CSS3, React, and native JavaScript."

  quote: "Hands down one of my favorite people with whom I've ever had the pleasure of working. Optimism that doesn't quit, a focus on extreme simplicity, and an innate ability to rapidly work through really complex UX problems. His presentation skills and EQ in a group are flawless, he takes and incorporates feedback with aplomb, but stands up for what's right if he doesn't agree."

  quote: "In the time I've been a developer and manager, I'm not sure I've bumped into another UX professional with the unique blend of design, branding, user empathy, and technical insight that Travis brings to all of his work. It's the effortless chemistry he has with both business and engineers that has drawn so many people to pursuing a work relationship with him over the years. Travis is deeply principled, ethical, in touch with the modern Web, and capable of digesting the most complex business and user problemsâ€“ making the resulting experience so simple as to seem like it should have been obvious from the start. He is a truly gifted professional and a powerful addition to any seriously product-focused team."
